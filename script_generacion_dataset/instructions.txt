In case there is any problem with the library, its installations are simple and usually do not give problems:
	*Installation from conda shell: conda install nameLibrary
	*Installation from notebook: !pip install nameLibrary

For each associated notebook in each basin, the historical trace file 'Allstorms.ibtracs_wmo.v03r09.nc' is required.

For cyclone_files_generator it is necessary to have reproduced the notebooks of each basin and to take out each .nc file of each basin. Besides, you have to be careful,
in the script certain things about the automation have to be changed:
	*The directory from which the raw precipitation and sst data are read
	*The names of the precipitation and sst files, since the reading of the same is based on the name of the file that collects the year,month,day and hour.
	For example, '%Y%m%d-%H.nc4' is the format of the precipitation files. Therefore, it is advisable to automate the process so that the
	name of the file indicate which year, month, day and hour it corresponds to.

To AgruparDatosBruto you need to have previously executed the All_basin file. AgruparDatosBruto generates the raw_data.nc4 file, which is necessary for the
and its validation.
