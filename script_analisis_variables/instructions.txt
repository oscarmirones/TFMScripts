For the operation of the Matrices_con_dataframe script you only need to have the file 'raw_data.nc4' in the same directory as the notebook.
In case there is any problem with the library, its installation is simple and usually does not give problems:
	*Installation from conda shell: conda install nameLibrary
	*Installation from notebook: !pip install nameLibrary

The rest of the scripts are each associated with an ocean basin. The following is necessary for their use. Suppose we deal with the basin
Eastern Pacific (EP):
	* General file of the basin *basinEP.nc4*. Generated in EasternPacific_Basin.ipynb
	* The EP_cyclones directory with all its generated files
		- dist_cyclonep
		- ang_cyclonep
		- precip_cyclonep
		- cyclonep

	These files are all generated in the cyclone_files_generator scripts in the script_generation_dataset directory
	
This procedure is done with each basin, the names of the files in each case are similar except for the "coletilla" that indicates which basin they belong to.
